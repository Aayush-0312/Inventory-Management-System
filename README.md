🎓 Inventory Management System (C Language)
________________________________________
Overview

This project is a console-based Inventory Management System developed using the C programming language. It demonstrates how core C concepts can be applied to build a simple, real-world application for managing inventory records efficiently.

The system allows users to add, update, delete, and view inventory items through a menu-driven interface. Each item is stored using structures and managed using arrays, making the project suitable for understanding data handling and structured programming in C.
